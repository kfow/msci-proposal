abstract="This work addresses information needs that have a temporal dimension conveyed by a temporal expression in the user's query. Temporal expressions such as ``in the 1990s'' are frequent, easily extractable, but not leveraged by existing retrieval models. One challenge when dealing with them is their inherent uncertainty. It is often unclear which exact time interval a temporal expression refers to.",

The test collection consists of approx. 18,000 monographic records, 160,000 papers and journal articles in PDF and 275,000 abstracts with a varied set of metadata and vocabularies from the physics domain, 65 topics based on real work tasks and corresponding graded relevance assessments. The test collection may be used for systems- as well as user-oriented evaluation.",
